Terpenes constitute the largest class of plant secondary (or specialized) metabolites, which are compounds of ecological function in plant defense or the attraction of beneficial organisms.
Terpenoids are a class of compounds, made of isoprene building blocks, that are found in all living organisms (Gershenzon & Dudareva, 2007). In plants, terpenoids play essential roles in myriad general physiological and biochemical processes such as photosynthesis, electron transport, developmental regulation and membrane architecture, with many of these roles shared with other organisms (Pichersky & Raguso, 2018). However, the majority of terpenoids in plants identified by far are those that evolved in different lineages as adaptations for specific ecological niches and are therefore defined as specialised terpenoid metabolites. Such metabolites serve in attracting pollinators and seed dispersers, in defence against pathogens and herbivores, and in attracting useful soil microorganism (Gershenzon & Dudareva, 2007; Pichersky & Raguso, 2018). Because of their functions, biosynthesis of specialised terpenes in plants is usually restricted to specific tissues or cell types, such as flowers (Dudareva et al., 1998, 2003; Chen et al., 2003; Tholl et al., 2004), roots (Chen et al., 2004; Vaughan et al., 2013) or glandular trichomes found at the surface of leaves, stems and fruits (Iijima et al., 2004; Schilmiller et al., 2009; Booth et al., 2017).

Callose plays an important role in the development and maturation of stamens and anthers in plant sexual reproduction.
Callose and plasmodesmata conductivity.
Plant viruses spread in plants mainly through plasmodesmata. Virus-encoded movement proteins (MPs), such as the tobacco mosaic virus MP, can change the permeability of plasmodesmata and transport viral genetic material from one cell to another. The dynamic synthesis of callose at plasmodesmata is the major factor that regulates the pore size of plasmodesmata, therefore the spread of plant viruses is largely controlled by callose synthesis.
In addition to biotic stresses like pathogen infection, several abiotic stresses such as heavy metals, could also induce biogenesis of callose in planta.

OG0001991 - MTR_3g051230: cytochrome P450 family protein, putative
Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are the largest enzyme family involved in NADPH- and/or O2-dependent hydroxylation reactions across all the domains of life. In plants and animals, CYPs play a central role in the detoxification of xenobiotics. In addition to this function, CYPs act as versatile catalysts and play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, antioxidants, and phytohormones in higher plants. The molecular and biochemical processes catalyzed by CYPs have been well characterized, however, the relationship between the biochemical process catalyzed by CYPs and its effect on several plant functions was not well established. The advent of next-generation sequencing opened new avenues to unravel the involvement of CYPs in several plant functions such as plant stress response. The expression of several CYP genes are regulated in response to environmental stresses, and they also play a prominent role in the crosstalk between abiotic and biotic stress responses. CYPs have an enormous potential to be used as a candidate for engineering crop species resilient to biotic and abiotic stresses. The objective of this review is to summarize the latest research on the role of CYPs in plant stress response.

OG0002608 - AT1G11340: G-type lectin S-receptor-like Serine/Threonine-kinase. Pollen recognition, protein phosphorylation.
S-domain receptor-like kinases (SD-RLKs) are an important and multi-gene subfamily of plant receptor-like/pelle kinases (RLKs), which are known to play a significant role in the development and immune responses of Arabidopsis thaliana. The conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of SD-RLKs make them interesting candidates for sensing reactive oxygen species (ROS), assisting oxidative stress mitigation and associated signaling pathways during abiotic stresses. However, how closely SD-RLKs are interrelated to abiotic stress mitigation and signaling remains unknown in A. thaliana.
To summarize, the computational analysis and differential transcript accumulation of SD-RLKs under various abiotic stresses suggested their association with abiotic stress tolerance and related signaling in A. thaliana. We believe that a further detailed study will decipher the specific role of these representative SD-RLKs in abiotic stress mitigation vis-a-vis signaling pathways in A. thaliana.

OG0004755 - AT1G16705: p300/CBP acetyltransferase-related protein-like protein. carboxylic acid biosynthetic process, heterocycle biosynthetic process, organic cyclic compound biosynthetic process
p300 and CBP participate as transcriptional coregulators in the execution of a wide spectrum of cellular gene expression programs controlling cell differentiation, growth and homeostasis. Both proteins act together with sequence-specific transcription factors to modify chromatin structure of target genes via their intrinsic acetyltransferase activity directed towards core histones and some transcription factors. So far, p300-related proteins have been described in animals ranging from Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. In this report, we describe p300/CBP-like polypeptides in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Interestingly, homology between animal and plant p300/CBP is largely restricted to a C-terminal segment, about 600 amino acids in length, which encompasses acetyltransferase and E1A-binding domains. We have examined whether this conservation in sequence is paralleled by a conservation in function. The same amino acid residues critical for acetyltransferase activity in human p300 are also critical for the function of one of the plant orthologs. Remarkably, plant proteins bind to the adenovirus E1A protein in a manner recapitulating the binding specificity of mammalian p300/CBP. The striking conservation of an extended segment of p300/CBP suggests that it may constitute a functional entity fulfilling functions that may be essential for all metazoan organisms. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC30400/
CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its homolog p300 possess histone acetyltransferase activity and function as key transcriptional co-activators in the regulation of gene expression that controls differentiation and development in animals. However, the role of CBP/p300-like genes in plants has not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that Arabidopsis CBP/p300-like genes promote flowering by affecting the expression of a major floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Although animal CBP and p300 generally function as co-activators, Arabidopsis CBP/p300-like proteins are required for the negative regulation of FLC. This CBP/p300-mediated FLC repression may involve reversible protein acetylation independent of histone modification within FLC chromatin.

Recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) derived from invading pathogens by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) initiates a subset of defense responses known as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Transcription factors (TFs) orchestrate the onset of PTI through complex signaling networks. Here, we characterized the function of ERF19, a member of the Arabidopsis thaliana ethylene response factor (ERF) family. ERF19 was found to act as a negative regulator of PTI against Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae. Notably, overexpression of ERF19 increased plant susceptibility to these pathogens and repressed MAMP-induced PTI outputs. In contrast, expression of the chimeric dominant repressor ERF19-SRDX boosted PTI activation, conferred increased resistance to the fungus B. cinerea, and enhanced elf18-triggered immunity against bacteria. Consistent with a negative role for ERF19 in PTI, MAMP-mediated growth inhibition was weakened or augmented in lines overexpressing ERF19 or expressing ERF19-SRDX, respectively. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we show that the transcriptional co-repressor Novel INteractor of JAZ (NINJA) associates with and represses the function of ERF19. Our work reveals ERF19 as a novel player in the mitigation of PTI, and highlights a potential role for NINJA in fine-tuning ERF19-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis innate immunity. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30462256/
Phytophthora species are destructive plant pathogens that cause significant crop losses worldwide. To understand plant susceptibility to oomycete pathogens and to explore novel disease resistance strategies, we employed the Arabidopsis thaliana-Phytophthora parasitica model pathosystem and screened for A. thaliana T-DNA insertion mutant lines resistant to P. parasitica. This led to the identification of the resistant mutant 267-31, which carries two T-DNA insertion sites in the promoter region of the ethylene-responsive factor 19 gene (ERF019). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assays showed that the expression of ERF019 was induced during P. parasitica infection in the wild type, which was suppressed in the 267-31 mutant. Additional erf019 mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and were confirmed to have increased resistance to P. parasitica. In contrast, ERF019 overexpression lines were more susceptible. Transient overexpression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that the nuclear localization of ERF019 is crucial for its susceptible function. RT-qPCR analyses showed that the expression of marker genes for multiple defence pathways was significantly up-regulated in the mutant compared with the wild type during infection. Flg22-induced hydrogen peroxide accumulation and reactive oxygen species burst were impaired in ERF019 overexpression lines, and flg22-induced MAPK activation was enhanced in erf019 mutants. Moreover, transient overexpression of ERF019 strongly suppressed INF-triggered cell death in N. benthamiana. These results reveal the importance of ERF019 in mediating plant susceptibility to P. parasitica through suppression of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity. https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mpp.12971

Plant U-box type E3 ubiquitin ligases (PUBs) are well known for their functions in a variety of stress responses, including immune responses and the adaptation to abiotic stresses. First linked to pollen self-incompatibility, their repertoire of roles has grown to encompass also the regulation of developmental processes. Notably, new studies provide clues to their mode of action, underline the existence of conserved PUB–kinase modules, and suggest new links to G-protein signalling, placing PUBs at the crossroads of major signalling hubs. The frequent association with membranes, by interacting and/or targeting membrane proteins, as well as through a recently reported direct interaction with phospholipids, indicates a general function in the control of vesicle transport and their cargoes. This review aims to give an overview of the most significant advances in the field, while also trying to identify common themes of PUB function.

OG0010096 - AT2G20790: clathrin adaptor complexes medium subunit family protein. endosomal transport, intracellular protein transport, vesicle-mediated transport

In mammals, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) depends on the heterotetrameric ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX-2 (AP-2). Our work identifies the components of the Arabidopsis thaliana AP-2 and shows that the machinery of CME in plants is evolutionarily conserved. Our data reveal that AP-2 mediates the endocytosis of the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1.
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) regulates many aspects of plant development, including hormone signaling and responses to environmental stresses. Despite the importance of this process, the machinery that regulates CME in plants is largely unknown.

To date, there have been no reports of the requirement for a clathrin-associated protein complex in early senescence and cell death in plants. In the current study, we demonstrated that a novel rice LMM carries a mutation that causes a loss of function of AP1M1. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of lesion occurrence, and to clarify the important function of AP1M1 in the vesicular transport system and the induction of plant hypersensitive cell death in rice.

Using a map-based cloning approach, we determined that SPL28 encodes a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit μ1 (AP1M1), which is involved in the post-Golgi trafficking pathway. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein of SPL28 (SPL28::GFP) localized to the Golgi apparatus, and expression of SPL28 complemented the membrane trafficking defect of apm1-1Δ yeast mutants. SPL28 was ubiquitously expressed and contained a highly conserved adaptor complex medium subunit (ACMS) family domain.

SPL28 appears to be involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, and SPL28 dysfunction causes the formation of hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions, leading to the initiation of leaf senescence.
